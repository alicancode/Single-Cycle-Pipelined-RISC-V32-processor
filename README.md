# Single-Cycle-Pipelined-RISC-V32-processor
I made this project as a part of my internship program at NCDC at NUST. 
The best thing about this project is the ecstasy I felt after making things work after hours of debugging. Trying out different instructions and seeing where there might be hazards and trying to resolve them.

To be quite frank, this is my first major project that has seen completion.
I don't intend to stop here though. As much as I really enjoyed building this project, I still think I can improve upon it in numerous ways.
Next time i want to consult the RISC-V32 Instruction set manual even more than I did this time around. 

Secondly, I want to add extensions to it as well. Given time, I want to add M-type instructions to the processor as well. I want to try and implement wallace trees for multiplication (which is not a big ordeal). And maybe even floating point handling or even a vector processing unit.
But for now I want to take a break from this. My capstone/FYP project awaits and I want to smash it out of the ballpark:).

Lastly a huge thanks to my fellow interns and supervisors that helped me whenever I hit a deadend. I really enjoyed working with you guys.
